# Football Match Predictor

Predicting Italian Serie A match outcomes (home win / draw / away win) from historical results and team performance statistics.

The project compares a simple baseline built on historical team form against more advanced machine-learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

## Project structure

```
football-match-predictor/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/            # Original downloaded CSVs (not tracked in git)
│   └── processed/      # Cleaned, feature-engineered datasets (not tracked)
├── notebooks/          # Exploration, analysis and presentation of results
├── src/                # Reusable pipeline code (loading, cleaning, features, models)
├── tests/              # Automated tests (pytest)

│   └── models/         # Saved trained models (not tracked)

└── README.md
```

Python scripts in `src/` hold the pipeline logic. Notebooks import from `src/` and are used for exploration, charts and presenting findings.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```powershell
# From the DI-Bootcamp repo root, move into the project folder
cd football-match-predictor

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Check everything is working
pytest
```

In VS Code, choose the `.venv` interpreter (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Python: Select Interpreter") so notebooks and scripts use the same environment.

## Data

Historical match data comes from [Football-Data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/italym.php) (Serie A results and match statistics by season). Raw files are downloaded by the project scripts rather than committed to the repository.

Download every Serie A season (1993-94 to the current season) into `data/raw/`:

```powershell
python -m src.data_loader                      # all seasons
python -m src.data_loader --from-season 2005   # 2005-06 onwards only
python -m src.data_loader --force              # re-download everything
```

Files are saved as `data/raw/I1_<season>.csv` (e.g. `I1_2425.csv` for 2024-25; `I1` is Football-Data's code for Serie A). Re-running the script skips seasons already downloaded but always refreshes the current season, which is updated after every matchday.

Then combine all seasons into one standardised dataset:

```powershell
python -m src.preprocessing
```

This reads every raw file, fixes the format differences between seasons (ragged rows, two date formats, renamed odds columns, byte-order marks), validates the result, and writes `data/processed/matches.csv`, one row per match. Load it in notebooks with `src.preprocessing.load_matches()` to keep the correct column types. [notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb](notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb) walks through each step.

| Columns | Content | Available from |
|---|---|---|
| `season`, `season_start`, `date`, `time` | When the match was played (`time` from 2019-20) | 1993-94 |
| `home_team`, `away_team` | Team names | 1993-94 |
| `home_goals`, `away_goals`, `result` | Full-time score and result (`H` / `D` / `A`) | 1993-94 |
| `ht_home_goals`, `ht_away_goals`, `ht_result` | Half-time score and result | 1995-96 |
| `home_shots`, `home_shots_on_target`, `home_fouls`, `home_corners`, `home_yellow_cards`, `home_red_cards` (and `away_` equivalents) | Match statistics | 2005-06 |
| `b365_home`, `b365_draw`, `b365_away` | Bet365 decimal odds | 2002-03 |
| `avg_odds_home`, `avg_odds_draw`, `avg_odds_away` | Market-average decimal odds | 2005-06 |
| `referee` | Referee | 2005-06 to 2006-07 only |
